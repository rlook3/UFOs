# UFOs

## Overview

I am working with Dana to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings on her website by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, users will be able to filter for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

When someone reaches the webpage and wants to specify their search, he/she can simply type in the criteria they want to look for whether that's in one field or multiple fields. As soon as they press 'Enter', the table will adjust to show results matching their query. For example, I can type 'ca' into the State box and see all the UFO sightings in California. I can then add in a city like 'el cajon to get an even more filtered list of results.

## Summary

One drawback with this design is that the inputs have to be perfectly matching (spelling and case-sensitive) for results to populate. A few improvements I'd like to revisit would be loosening the case sensitivity during the search, adding an option to show results in a range of dates, and including the total number of results per filter.
